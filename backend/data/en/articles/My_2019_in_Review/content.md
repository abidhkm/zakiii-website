I have to admit that it was a great year where I got to meet with a number of people, made new awesome friends, and got the opportunity to share great ideas with them. What a great year to be alive!

So, let me try and summarize my year, I sure do hope that you guys will enjoy reading as much as I enjoyed writing this article.

## I Read Books, Paper Books

This actually started way back in 2018, where I found my brother's book laying around, I could hear it calling for me to read it lol, next thing I started to get a taste of reading it, and it felt better than reading electronic books, and definitely better than watching films and series, and the reason is that instead of just watching, you will use your brain and imagination to create what's happening in the story.

So yeah, I liked the process, and shortly after finishing reading my first book ever, I opted for others, one by one, and could never stop, although I didn't read that many, it's still not bad for a first timer, or is it??

Maybe one of the reasons I kept on reading books, is the free time on the university bus, which takes up to 30 to 40 minutes twice, that's more than a full hour every day, and during that time, I usually sit and never attempt to talk to anyone sitting next to me, which made me think of using it for something useful, and yes you guessed it right, I started reading in the bus, in fact, I finished more than 5 books mostly in the bus, what's even more, I made new friends, on the bus! Just because they thought I was reading one of their favorite books.

### The Alchemist

This is my brother's book, and the first one I read, a novel by Paulo Coelho, that tells the story of Santiago, an Andalusian shepherd boy who yearns to travel in search of his treasure.

I won't say no more, you can check my review of the book here:

### Veronika Decides to Die

Then I got another novel from a friend, by the same author, the one and only Paulo Coelho, this one tells the story of 24-year-old Slovenian Veronika, who appears to have everything in life going for her, but who decides to kill herself, why? Read the book to know why, it's a great story, definitely worth reading.

You can also check my review of the book here:

### Wuthering Heights

This one is a bit dark, got it from another friend, a novel by Emily Brontë, about a wild, passionate story of the intense and almost demonic love between Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff, a foundling adopted by Catherine's father.

You can tell already how the story will go, but I will let you read it, and hopefully enjoy it as much as I did. It actually has a film which I watched, mmm not bad I would say, anyway, check my review of the book here:

### A Tale of Two Cities

This one is my favorite, from the same one who gave me the last book, she also gave me this one too, A Tale of Two Cities, an 1859 historical novel by Charles Dickens, set in London and Paris before and during the French Revolution.

I can safely say: this short stroy is my favorite so far, you going to want to read it, check my review here:

### The Winner Stands Alone

I like this one too, I kind of relate to it somehow, maybe I’m not a winner, but I definitely stand alone. This novel by Paulo Coelho is one of my favorite, it talks about the fascinating worlds of fortune and celebrity. In fact this is the last English book I read in the last year, before I switched to French books.

Here's my review of the book:

## Started Reading Manga (in English)

It started when I finished one of my favorite anime, One Punch Man, I couldn't wait for a whole year for the next season, so I jumped straight to reading its manga, and eventually got hooked.

While I was sure having fun, the fact that the manga that I read are translated to English, is an actual plus, since I’m enjoying the manga, while at the same time learning English, so yeah the manga is one of the big reasons I got this far in English.

Now. I’m constantly reading manga, and I have three main ones that I simply can't skip: One Piece, One Punch Man, and Attack on Titan.

## Graduated with Master Degree

Last summer, I got my master degree, where I officially became an Electrical Engineer, don't let the title fool you, I’m still until this day, passionate about IT and Computer Science, and don't really care about Electronics. The Fun fact is that my graduation project is 80% IT the rest is an Electronic circuit and some math theories.

I was one of the few who chose to use English instead of French, that's what I’m truly proud of, and I encourage everyone to do the same.

Bits and pieces about my project, well it's basically a Desktop application (Electron), that you can use to generate Electrical signals, which you can send to an Electrical inverter. I developed the application in a way that lets you control every aspect of the generated signal, and I made sure that the Arduino board can handle any signal you gave it, yes, I was literally messing with its registers to get the best performance possible.

This is just talk, so where is the actual app? Well I’m going to open source it in the near future, and put it on Github, both Desktop and Arduino codes, so stay tuned for that:

## Attended Entrepreneurship Events

In late 2018, I participated in ELIP (Entrepreneurship, Leadership & Innovation Program), which is a program composed of bunch of events, across cities, and couple more national ones, I spent great time during those events, learned about design thinking, got out of my comfort zone, and met with great people, people that I can say will be able to change our country for the better.

I also learned the fact that, IT guys are so necessary for today's business, web developer specifically are key elements to each startup, so yeah, I was under heavy demand there, what made me make lot of great friends, and enlarge my network even more.

## Attended my First Hackathon (Tizi Ouzou)

This is a good one. At last, I went to Tizi Ouzou. So, I attended my first ever hackathon, it was great, I met with great people there, new and old friends, we shared really good moments and learned a lot together, and shared our knowledge with each other, the experience was great overall.

Hackathon are for solving real life problem, and this one is no exception, it focused on two main themes: Tourism, and Environment. Teams came from across the country, with innovative ideas.

I came to the hackathon with an Afro-like hair and with a unique idea, well that's what I thought, until I met with this cool afro girl, which happens to have the same idea as mine, with slight difference in BMC, so yeah, no matter how special you think you are, there are always people who will surprise you.

## Built my First Professional Desktop Application (Electron)

Heard of Electron? It’s a cool technology, it helps ease the process of developing Cross-platform Desktop apps, using web technologies like HTML, CSS and Javascript.

So, a client from Upwork wanted to build a desktop app, using Electron, this app connects to IRacing game simulator, read realtime data, and display it as widgets in the screen, so it's basically an extension to the game.

Sofar the app is in Alpha, we released it for couple of users only, I will let you know when it's available, so stay tuned here:

## Started Learning French

As far as IT jobs in Algeria are concerned, you NEED to have good level of French, which I’m really struggling at, that also goes for nearby countries, I received invitations for job interviews, 90% of them didn't go well because they require French, although I’m good at English. Actually, while i'm writing this article, i got an invitation for job interview, and yes you guessed it, it's a French company, so let's hope for the better this time, after all, this is my first interview in 2020 🙂.

So I thought of starting to learn French, it's not like i have no background knowledge, I know the basics and I can understand it in most cases; but I can't do a proper lengthy discussion, even with my French friends, I can only talk in English. My strategy is to start with Books for now.

### L'Étranger

I got this book from a friend who studies the French language, she recommended me this book, so I took it and read it, "L'etranger", a 1942 novel by French author Albert Camus, definitely worth your time especially the time you spend in bus 😉.

Here's my review of the first French book I read:

## Switched from Gitlab to GitHub

Since Github introduced Unlimited private repos, along with Github Actions CI for private repos with MacOS and Windows support, I had no reason to stick with Gitlab anymore, though there was a fundamental feature that GitLab has and Github doesn't, which is **project management** board, but after some research, I found ZenHub, which does the same thing if not better, and integrates well with Github, in fact they require u to have a Github account.

## Discovered Firebase, and Kinda Ditched Heroku

Well at least for my own projects, I will go with firebase from now on, why not, after all:

- I can host up to 10 apps (1GB storage, and 10GB/m bandwidth).
- My web apps will never go down due to traffic.
- I can add custom domains that i already own, to any of my web apps.
- I get free SSL as a bonus.
- Deployment is so easy, just run `firebase deploy`.

## Built Zakiii.com

Late 2019, I started developing zakiii.com, and published it in the beginning of 2020, my goal is to share my knowledge, showcase my realizations, and work on my online presence since I’m a developer that needs leads, and I can get those leads by building a good portfolio, for both client and employers.

I want to take this chance and thank my friend [Imad](https://www.instagram.com/imadabdennouri) for making a great logo for this website, you rock bro!

### Created Zakiii YouTube channel

I also created zakiii YouTube channel, I’m planning to add some videos that I believe will add values, and not just repeating what's already available on the platform, so let me know if there's a topic that I need to focus on.

If you are interested, here's a link to my YouTube channel:

## Lastly

I myself, didn't realize what I did accomplish this year, until I started writing this article, so I encourage you to do so, and start writing down what you have done this last year, it will help you feel better about yourself, and encourage you to do more. As Bill Gates said:

> If you can’t make good, at least make it look good

Also great Thanks to [Amina](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amina-benlouanas-789a5611b/) for helping me with the correction of this article.

Finally, thank you for taking the time to read this article! You rock!
